# SSY340 - Deep-Machine-Learning
The purpose with this course is to give a thorough introduction to deep machine learning, also known as deep learning or deep neural networks. Over the last few years, deep machine learning has dramatically changed the state of the art performance in various fields including speech-recognition, computer vision and reinforcement learning (used, e.g., to learn how to play Go). We focus primarily on basic principles regarding how these networks are constructed and trained, but we also cover many of the key techniques used in different applications. The overall objective is to provide a solid understanding of how and why deep machine learning is useful, as well as the skills to apply them to solve problems of practical importance.
